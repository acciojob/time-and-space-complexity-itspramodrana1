    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity describes how the running time of an algorithm grows with input size, helping developers judge how efficient. an algorithm is and compare different approaches based on performance.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as input size increases, often expressed using notations like O(n) to show linear memory growth.
